# WoodenMath
WoodenMath - math library which contains vectors, quaternions, matrix and other mathematical constuctions and operations. 
It supports SSE SIMD operations - SSE, AVX-2 and AVX-512 in the future. C++17 with meta-programming. 
Implemented:
1. DVector with support up to 4 elements and float, double, int32, uint32 types. 
2. DVector supports SSE, AVX-2
Not implemented yet:
1. DMatrix
2. Batching data for using 256 bit and 512 bit SSE operations
3. DQuaternions
4. Lerping functions (spherical, linear)
